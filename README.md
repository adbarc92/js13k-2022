Theme: death

## The Player Actor can...
* Bash: deals no damage, but stuns enemies for a short period.
* Deflect: divert an enemy's attack, stunning them for a long period.
* Strike: deals damage equivalent to held Shards of Death but cancels stun.
* Jump: be an Italian plumber, then a robot ninja.

## Mechanics
### Combo
* Combos can be built up by bashing or deflecting.
* Building up a combo will grant the player a Shard of Death (one for five, two for ten, three for fifteen, etc.).
* The combo will be lost when the player is struck.
### Shards of Death
* Damage can only be dealt or taken when possessing Shards of Death.
* Striking without any Shards of Death will prompt an immediate counter.
* The more Shards of Death one holds, the more damage they will deal and take.
* While holding Shards of Death, a countdown to death will occur.
